# Don't Be Mean

The basic principle is this: *don't be mean.* Let's treat each other the way we would if we were all face-to-face in a professional setting.

Most people understand what it means to be decent to each other, so I won't go into detail here.

Apart from the obvious concerns about discrimination, harassment, etc., three less-obvious things are worth mentioning:

 - Don't pick on people for bad code. We all write bad code sometimes, and we all started out as beginners.
 - None of that nationalistic nonsense, like "this PR came from [insert country], so watch out for your data."
 - If you think someone **is** being mean, try to give the benefit of the doubt first.

This code of conduct used to be a lot more verbose. If there's ever a need to expand it, we'll handle that when it comes up.
