## Base class for objects that can be used across multiple concurrent processes
##
## This is an abstract class and should not be instantiated directly.
## It provides methods for locking, unlocking, and setting encryption.
## Subclasses should implement their own methods for reading and writing data.
##
## Internally, it uses the file system to store the object's state.
