# Bash++ VSCode Extension

This extension provides language support for Bash++, including syntax highlighting and optional language server capabilities.

If the Bash++ language server is installed on your system, the extension will connect to it automatically and provide in-editor completions, error reporting, etc.

## Website

You can find more information about Bash++ at [bpp.sh](https://bpp.sh)

## Building from source

First, you need to install `npm`, `node` and `vsce`.

```bash
sudo apt install npm nodejs
sudo npm install -g vsce
```

Then, you can build the extension.

```bash
make
```

This will create a `.vsix` file that you can install in VSCode.

## Extension Information

### License: GNU GPL v3

This extension (as well as the Bash++ language and compiler) are licensed under the [GNU General Public License v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html).

### Language Server Support

By default, the extension will connect to the Bash++ language server **if it is installed on your system.**

If the extension cannot find `/usr/bin/bpp-lsp`, it will silently stop and *only* provide syntax highlighting.

You can configure the path to the language server (as well as other options) in the extension's settings

### Syntax Highlighting

The TextMate grammar is a modified version of the [Bash](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-textmate/blob/main/test-cases/themes/syntaxes/Shell-Unix-Bash.tmLanguage.json) grammar provided by Microsoft.

The original grammar is licensed under the [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)
