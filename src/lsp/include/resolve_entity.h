/**
 * @brief Resolves the entity referenced at the given line and column in the specified file.
 * 
 * This function uses the ANTLR4 parser to parse the line content and find the entity which is referenced at the specified column.
 * It returns a shared pointer to the resolved entity, or nullptr if no entity is found.
 * 
 * E.g, if the segment pointed to by the position contains `@MyClass myObject`, we will return a pointer to the `MyClass` class.
 * If the segment contains `@myObject.myMethod`, we will return a pointer to the `myMethod` method of the `myObject` object.
 * If the segment contains `@myObject`, we will return a pointer to the `myObject` object.
 * If the segment contains `@include <file>`, we will return a newly-constructed faux-entity that points to the resolved path of the included file.
 * 
 * @param file The file to resolve the entity in.
 * @param line The line number to resolve the entity at (0-indexed).
 * @param column The column number to resolve the entity at (0-indexed).
 * @param program The program to resolve the entity in.
 * @param utf16_mode Whether to use UTF-16 mode for character counting.
 * @param file_contents Alternative contents of the file to use instead of reading from the filesystem.
 * @return A shared pointer to the resolved entity, or nullptr if no entity is found.
