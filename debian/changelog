bpp (0.1.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Patch: Override get_code methods in bash_if_branch
    The base code_entity version of these methods return empty strings
    for pre-and post-code buffers
    This broke if statements that weren't split across multiple lines,
    and therefore never caused the code buffers to be flushed
  * Patch: Add stray terminal tokens to program
