# Code of Conduct

The basic principle is this: *don't be mean.* Let's treat each other the way we would if we were all face-to-face in a professional setting.

## Our Pledge

We, as contributors, maintainers, and users of this project, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free and inclusive experience for everyone, regardless of age, background, identity, nationality, ability, or any other characteristic. We value respect, collaboration, and fairness above all else.

## Our Standards

To ensure a positive and welcoming environment, we expect all community members to adhere to the following principles:

 - **Be Respectful:** Treat everyone with dignity and kindness. Disagreements are natural, but they should be handled constructively and without personal attacks.

 - **Be Inclusive:** Strive to create an environment where everyone feels welcome and valued. Avoid language or behavior that could make others feel unwelcome, discourage participation, or hinder collaboration.

 - **Be Collaborative:** Work together to improve the project. Share knowledge, listen to others, and be open to feedback.

 - **Be Fair:** Avoid making assumptions about others' intentions or perspectives. Give everyone the benefit of the doubt and assume good faith.

 - **Be Mindful of Global Perspectives:** Recognize that our community spans diverse cultures, nations, and experiences. Avoid language or actions that could be interpreted as dismissive, derogatory, or hostile toward any group, region, country, etc.
