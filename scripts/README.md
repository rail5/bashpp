# Bash++ Scripts

For now, this directory holds:

 - Some example Bash++ scripts in the format `scriptname.bpp`

 - Files in the format `scriptname-compiled.sh` which were *compiled by hand*

We'll be compiling by hand until the syntax is fully fleshed-out and we're ready to make the compiler proper

[Shellwatch](https://github.com/rail5/shellwatch) is a small program made to help with this effort
