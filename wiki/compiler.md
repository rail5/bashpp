# Using the Bash++ compiler

# Basic usage

`bpp [options] [file] ...`

```bash
$ bpp src.bpp            # Compile & immediately run the program
$ bpp -o out.sh src.bpp  # Compile & save the program to out.sh
$ bpp -o - src.bpp       # Compile & print the program to stdout
$ cat src.bpp | bpp      # Pipe command output to the compiler
$ bpp -h # Display help
$ bpp -v # Display version
```

If no input file is specified, the compiler will read from stdin.

Arguments after the input file are passed to the compiled program.

# Options

###### `-o <file>`, `--output <file>`

Specify the output file for the compiled program.

If the output file is `-`, the program will be printed to stdout.

If the output file is not specified, the program will be executed immediately after compilation.

###### `-b <version>`, `--target-bash <version>`

Specify the target Bash version for the compiled program.

The default is Bash 5.2. This affects how the program is compiled, but does not change Bash++ syntax.

###### `-I <path>`, `--include <path>`

Add a directory to the include paths.

The default include path is `/usr/lib/bpp/stdlib`

Files in the include paths can be included with `@include <file>`. Include paths are searched in the order they are given.

###### `-s`, `--no-warnings`

Suppress all warnings during compilation.

###### `-t`, `--tokens`

Display the tokens generated by the lexer (do not compile).

###### `-p`, `--parse-tree`

Display the parse tree generated by the parser (do not compile).

###### `-h`, `--help`

Display help information.

###### `-v`, `--version`

Display the version of the Bash++ compiler.

# Include Paths

When an include directive is given with angle-brackets (as in `@include <file>`), the compiler will search for the file in the include paths. By default, `/usr/lib/bpp/stdlib` is the first include path.

Multiple include paths can be added with the `-I` option. The paths are searched in the order they are given.
