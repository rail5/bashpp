bpp (0.2.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed #4:
    Do not emit the 'connective' token in contexts in which the
    connective symbol should be interpreted as a literal
    Also recognize a solitary pipe as a valid connective

bpp (0.2.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added a small standard library to store common data structures
    This standard library will be provided by the libstd-bpp package
    Which package will be a dependency of bpp
    Standard library has for now: Array, Stack, Queue
  * Added option for dynamic linking (-D) in the compiler
    If dynamic linking is enabled, the code from @include'd files will
    Not be copied into your compiled file, but instead, your compiled
    Program will contain a Bash "source" directive pointing to the
    Compiled version of the dynamically linked library, linking it at
    Runtime.
    If you dynamically link an included file such as:
    /usr/lib/bpp/stdlib/Stack.bpp
    Your compiled program will expect to be able to find at runtime:
    /usr/lib/bpp/stdlib/Stack.sh
  * Added support for angle-bracket includes and compiler include paths
    A Bash++ directive such as @include <file> will scan the include
    Paths for the given file.
    The default include path is /usr/lib/bpp/stdlib
    More include paths can be added with the -I option in the compiler
    Include paths will be searched in the order in which they are added
  * Properly parse Bash while loops
  * @new properly returns a pointer (thanks to supershells)
  * Patch: Ensure methods and datamembers don't share names

bpp (0.1.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Patch: Override get_code methods in bash_if_branch
    The base code_entity version of these methods return empty strings
    for pre-and post-code buffers
    This broke if statements that weren't split across multiple lines,
    and therefore never caused the code buffers to be flushed
  * Patch: Add stray terminal tokens to program

bpp (0.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Initial release
    Bash++ is still considered to be in beta (or alpha, take your pick)
    And is expected to break often and have many bugs.
    Please report any bugs you find to the GitHub issue tracker:
